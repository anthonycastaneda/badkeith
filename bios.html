				<p>Bad Acid is an Austin-based noise rock / art punk band built on abrasion, repetition, and pressure.
					Drawing from
					post-punk, no wave, and underground rock traditions, the band favors tension over polish and impact
					over excess.
					The current lineup formed in 2025.
					Bad Acid was recently featured in the Austin Chronicle as the headliner for Metal Monday at Far Out
					Lounge.
					New material in the works.
